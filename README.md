# Welcome to this Repo!

Hi! I'm Jesus and rhis repo is for the technical evaluation of frontend developer for **spybee**, there will be certain details that I will explain in this document.

# Description

The basic project contains a react based in **Nextjs** framework folder structure with some additionals like utils, interfaces and more. The default project contains the tailwind but the modules are developed with **Vanilla CSS** and media queries. I also added the **Mapbox GL** integrations (I love it) to display each coordinates by projects. 

**OBSERVACIONS**  : Some of the coordinates (lat & lng) are wrong, I mean I know is just mock data but dont let it surprise you when the map marker are on the sea or the middle of nowhere.

Other features are the state management with zustand and some approaches to simulate tokens authentications.

I would have preferred to receive some kind of mockup in figma or something like that, but I understand privacy, however I did my best by copying the colors and some elements from the PDF.
